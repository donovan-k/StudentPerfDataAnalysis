# This is a python program that is used to analize a student performance dataset on groups based on gender, race, level of education, and so on.
# Data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

# Main files are:
compare_by_greater.py, compare_by_mean.py, and statistical_measurements.py

# So far I have compared male and female scores along with overall scores for math, reading, and writing.

# P.S (I used PyCharm for this project)
