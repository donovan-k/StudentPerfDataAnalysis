# This is a python program that is used to analize a student performance dataset on groups based
# on gender, race, level of education, and so on. 
# Main files are:
# compare_by_greater.py, compare_by_mean.py, and statistical_measurements.py
# 
# So far I have only compared male and female math, reading, and writing scores
#
# P.S (I used PyCharm for this project)
