# This is a python program that is used to analize a student performance dataset on groups based on gender, race, level of parents education, what kind of lunch, and whether they have taken the test preparation course.
# Data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

# Main files are:
compare_by_greater.py, compare_by_mean.py, statistical_measurements.py, and FindStatsUser

# So far the first two compare math and female scores, the third compares statistic values for math, reading and writing scores, and the fourth one asks the user for classification and shows average scores for math through writing and shows for each idenity they choose

# P.S (I used PyCharm for this project)

# These are pictures of ploting results
